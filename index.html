    <h3>Watching Travel Vlogs</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Watching travel vlogs gives us a great exposure to the world.</b> It brings us to experience the other side of life that we haven't seen yet. Though visiting in person gives us live experience, due to certain reasons if we are unable to go in person, travel vlogs comes in with its advantages. We can get to know about these from the Internet. <b>Youtube</b> is one of the most popular platform were we can come across a plethora of travel vlogs. Of all those available on the Youtube, I recommend you to watch the channel <b>Mountain Trekker</b>.
